VISUALIZING CLIMATE FROM DATA SET

Humans are really great at pattern recognition, but not so much when it comes to a mass of numbers â€“ 
we frequently need to translate data to some other format in order to figure out what the patterns are.

This project is exploring the graphing functionality of pandas to create visual representations of a dataset.
I summarize a set of characteristics from this data for a fixed time period by using at least three different 
representations of the same data subset.
